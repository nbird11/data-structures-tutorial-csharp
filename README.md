# C# Data Structures Tutorial

## Intro

Throughout the course of this tutorial, we will take a look at three different data structures that are common in many
programming languages and apply their use cases to anyone! The objective is for the average Joe to be able to
understand and be able to see these types of structures in their lives.

## Modules

- [Stack](./1-stack.md)
- [Linked List](./2-linkedList.md)
- [Tree](./3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your
own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
