# Stack

## Introduction

Imagine a stack of plates where you always add a new plate to the top and remove the topmost plate when you need one â€“
that's the essence of a stack. In computer science, a stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In,
First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Operations

### Push

The `push` operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack. This is analogous to placing a new plate on top
of the stack of plates.

### Pop

The `pop` operation is used to remove the top element from the stack. It's similar to lifting the top plate off the
stack of plates.

### Peek

The `peek` operation allows you to view the top element without removing it. It's like checking the top plate without
actually taking it off the stack.

## Efficiency of Common Operations

Stacks are efficient for certain operations:

- **Push, Pop, and Peek:** All three operations have a time complexity of O(1), meaning their execution time is
constant and does not depend on the size of the stack.

## Benefits/Uses

One of the key benefits of a stack is in tracking actions or changes in a way that facilitates easy reversal or
retrieval. Some examples of easy reversal that would benefit from the use of a stack might include:

- The undo button for a text document
- Forward and backward buttons for a webpage

## Example

Let's take a look at an example of a usage for a stack in C#, going back to the plates metaphor from the intro.

In this example, we can add a plate to the top using `Push`, see what the top plate was using `Peek`, and take the
top plate off the top of the stack using `Pop`. We can also see how many plates are currently in the stack using
an attribute of the plateStack called `Count`.

```csharp
private static void Main()
    {
        // Create a stack of plates
        var plateStack = new Stack<string>();

        // Push plates onto the stack
        plateStack.Push("Plate 1");
        plateStack.Push("Plate 2");
        plateStack.Push("Plate 3");

        // Print information about the current state of the stack
        Console.WriteLine("Top plate: " + plateStack.Peek());  // Plate 3
        Console.WriteLine("Stack size: " + plateStack.Count);  // 3

        // Take (pop) a plate off the stack
        string removedPlate = plateStack.Pop();
        Console.WriteLine("Removed plate: " + removedPlate);  // Plate 3
        Console.WriteLine("Stack size after pop: " + plateStack.Count);  // 2
    }
```

## Problem to Solve: Postfix Expressions

Write a C# program to evaluate a given postfix expression.

A postfix expression is an expression in which each operator follows its operands.
For example, the infix expression "3 + 4" is written as "3 4 +" in postfix notation. The expression is evaluated from
left to right.

Implement a function EvaluatePostfixExpression that takes a string representing a postfix expression as input and
returns the result of the expression.

Example:
- Input: "23*5+"
- Output: 11 (Explanation: 2 * 3 + 5 => 6 + 5 = 11)
<br>
<br>
- Input: "68+42/*"
- Output: 28 (Explanation: (6 + 8) * (4 / 2) => 14 * 2 = 28)
